# Summary

This project is a codealong based on the "[Rewriting Tetris to 2-player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJo5JpbuTTs)" video course by [Pontius "Meth Meth Method" Alexander](https://twitter.com/pomle). I'd already written the first version of the game (being the single-player edition), and I thought this two-player edition would be an interesting addition to my portfolio. Pontius has provided his own itemized, chapter-separated code on his [Github repo](https://github.com/meth-meth-method/super-mario), though I've followed along with the coding and have made every effort to provide comments to show that I actually understand what I'm typing, and not simply following along like a monkey.

### Running the Game

This game will run in any browser, and I'm sure of this because I built it using Pale Moon, so whatever browser you're using, it'll definitely work. I mention this because Pontius's "Super Mario" series has to be built using Google Chrome (building it on anything else just gave me nothing but headaches). Simply open whatever browser you prefer using, drag the "index.html" file into the browser window, and enjoy.

### Controls

On this two-player edition, I've set it up so that you and whomever else you're playing with can use the 10-key number set along the top of the keyboard. In the original course, Pontius sets it up so that the motions are attached to letters, and I use a Dvorak layout, so I found the controls to be completely unintuitive, and in my version, I set it up for the 10-key controls.

###### Player 1 (who would be sitting on the left) would control the motions as follows:

1 = Rotate
2 = Left
3 = Down
4 = Right

###### and Player 2 (who would obviously be sitting on the right), controls the pieces thusly:

7 = Left
8 = Down
9 = Right
0 = Rotate

My reasoning behind setting up the controls this way is that, because (I assume) that rotating is probably the least-used motion, then it should be controllable using your pinkie (since it's the weakest finger), and the other motion controls, being bound to stronger fingers, should actually reflect the motion on the screen.
